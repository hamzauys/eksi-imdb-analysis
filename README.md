#  Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between the number of entries in **Ekşi Sözlük** (a popular Turkish online forum) about a film and the film's **IMDb score** after release. The goal is to determine whether  discussion volume on Ekşi Sözlük can be an indicator of a film's quality as measured by IMDb ratings.

##  Key Research Questions
- Does a higher number of Ekşi Sözlük entriesrelease correlate with higher IMDb scores?
- Are there differences based on release year?
- Can we use Ekşi Sözlük entry data to predict IMDb ratings?

## Methods and Techniques
-Web Scraping** (to collect entry counts from Ekşi Sözlük)  
-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** (handling missing values, formatting data)  
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
-Statistical Analysis** (correlation tests, hypothesis testing)  

##  Expected Findings
The analysis will help determine whether social discussion volume can predict IMDb ratings. If a strong correlation exists, this could suggest that online discussions influence—or at least reflect—public opinion about films.
