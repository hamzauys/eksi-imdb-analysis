#  Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between the number of entries in **Ekşi Sözlük** (a popular Turkish online forum) about a film before its release and the film's **IMDb score** after release. The goal is to determine whether pre-release discussion volume on Ekşi Sözlük can be an indicator of a film's quality as measured by IMDb ratings.

##  Key Research Questions
- Does a higher number of Ekşi Sözlük entries before a film's release correlate with higher IMDb scores?
- Are there differences based on genre or release year?
- Can we use Ekşi Sözlük entry data to predict IMDb ratings?

## Methods and Techniques
✔ **Web Scraping** (to collect entry counts from Ekşi Sözlük)  
✔ **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** (handling missing values, formatting data)  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✔ **Statistical Analysis** (correlation tests, hypothesis testing)  
✔ **Machine Learning** (regression models to predict IMDb scores)  

##  Expected Findings
The analysis will help determine whether social discussion volume before release can predict IMDb ratings. If a strong correlation exists, this could suggest that online discussions influence—or at least reflect—public opinion about films.
